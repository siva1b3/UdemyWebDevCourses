      Understanding Favicon: Enhancing Web Presentation
    </h1>
    <p>
      Favicon, short for 'Favorite Icon,' is a small graphic representation
      associated with a website, often resembling a logo or a distinctive
      symbol. It plays a significant role in enhancing the user experience by
      providing a recognizable image for the website.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a user visits a website, the favicon is displayed in various places,
      including the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and history. This
      helps users quickly identify and navigate to their desired site among
      multiple open tabs or bookmarks.
    </p>

    <p>
      To implement a favicon, you need to include a link to the favicon file in
      the HTML file's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section using the
      <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element. The <code>rel</code> attribute with a
      value of <code>"shortcut icon"</code> signifies the favicon, and the
      <code>href</code> attribute points to the location of the favicon image
      file.
    </p>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example of adding a favicon to a webpage:</p>

    <img
      src="./favicon.jpg"
      alt="screenshot image"
      width="500px"
      height="300px"
    />
  </body>
