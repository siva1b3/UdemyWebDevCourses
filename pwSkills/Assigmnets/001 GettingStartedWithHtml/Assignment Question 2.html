      HTML comments are used to add explanations or notes within your HTML code.
      These comments are not displayed in the web browser when the page is
      rendered and are meant for developers and anyone else who might be reading
      the code to understand it better. Comments are an essential part of good
      coding practices because they make your code more readable and
      maintainable.
